Ottolinger AW21 is a collection for a drastically changed world.
We have lost and renewed our faith in the power of creativity. A duality that is embedded in our “future-elf” collection which features healing knits, comforting dresses, exaggerated and dreamlike prints by Cheyenne Julien, business suits for the third dimension, and shielding outerwear intuitively sculpted as if by nature, after a billion years of random mutations.

The clothes have the ability to convey a variety of effects, from comfort to happiness or intense curiosity – often at the same time.

Ottolinger AW21 is fundamentally a grand tale of both realism and futural magic; a melding of past-reinterpretation and future-hope crafting that draws on themes of rebellion, resistance, transformation of tradition, and a defiance of authority: all key pillars of the “future-elf” aesthetic.
