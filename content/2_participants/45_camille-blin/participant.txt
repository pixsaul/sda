Text:

*Quartier* is a table and chair set commissioned by the French outdoor furniture brand Tectona. The proposal responds to a desire to create urban and functional furniture which can be easily stored, intended for example to equip a caf√© terrace. The name *Quartier* is also an allusion to these two characteristics: its urban context and the complementarity of its elements. The chairs have various functional qualities: they can be slid together under the round table, but they can also be stacked in a compact pile, a property that is also found in the table.
Although it fits into a precise typology of furniture, the particular design of the chair, with its three legs and its triangular seat, is not the result of a pre-established design. On the contrary, the form is the outcome of an intuitive process, a progressive modelling reminiscent of sculpture. My goal is to make the object evolve by focusing on the feeling it generates while constantly keeping in mind the many functional requirements.
