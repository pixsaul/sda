Text:

My stage sets are autonomous players. I’m looking for a single image that acts as a representation of the play and in which my attitude towards the text becomes visible. The stage sets condense the atmosphere of the play or counteract it and are part of the staging concept with the actors.
My stage sets are beautiful and eerie, anti-naturalistic and concrete, shrill and fragile, funny and poetic. I am interested in the unification of the seemingly incompatible and the model portrayal of society, social milieu and stories. This creates spaces that allow a clear view of the content and at the same time create their own cosmos with their own logic.
