*Grafix* is a series of office accessories that question and expand the functionality of the objects. During my childhood, I would sneak into my grandfather's office to explore his black Caran d'Ache pen and the myriad of tools he owned. This fascination has continued ever since and inspired me to create this project.
Based on the idea "less is more" rooted in sustainability, each tool of the *Grafix* family is a symbiosis of two. Building on these values and following deep and intensive research, I designed three objects with six different functions. The series encompasses a utility knife that is also a pair of scissors, a straight protractor that serves as a compass on the other side. Last but not least, a pencil ruler that can draw straight lines with a measurement indicator. By combining two products in one, the user can effortlessly and compactly store the tools in a case.

*Grafix* was developed during the 4th semester of my BA in Industrial Design at the @institutindustrialdesign, FHNW Academy of Art and Design in Basel.
