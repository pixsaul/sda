With his typeface *Synt*, Kaj Lehmann is researching late 19th-century modern typefaces – hot
 metal typefaces made for reading typography – and reimagining the genre in the context of
 today’s culture and technology.

Kaj started the project in 2017 on the MATD (@ecal_matd) programme at ECAL, during which
 he conceived and designed the 17th issue of zweikommasieben Magazin (@zweikommasieben), a
 Swiss magazine focusing on contemporary music and sounds that he co-founded in 2011.

 Reflecting on the magazine’s topic, *Synt* is radically embracing rhythm and accentuation in
 typography: with vertical stems in letters always sitting at predefined positions – and therefore at
 equal intervals from each other – tension and dynamics automatically underlie any typographic
 layout created with* Synt*.

For the moment, *Synt* comes in three cuts: Upright, Slanted (which can be seamlessly
animated from 0 degrees to a 32-degree angle), as well as a true-italic cut. Together with the team of the
Swiss type foundry Dinamo (@abcdinamo), the typeface has been refined and mastered, and will
soon be available to designers worldwide. Further styles (Bold, Monospace) are in planning and
hopefully will follow in 2022/23.
