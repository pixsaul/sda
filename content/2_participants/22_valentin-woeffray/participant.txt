The two pieces are videos: one is an immersive projection, the other an installation made of two screens mounted on a stand.

The projects deal with the themes of surveillance, ultra-liberal capitalism and some of its manifestations. They were made exclusively using internet archive footage and Google Earth 3D render. They intend to confront the viewer with the different subjects explored by putting into perspective media that would not impact the spectator in the same way when watched on their original platform. They also aim to question our relationship to a certain kind of imagery and understand its implication in today’s world by creating fictional situations through CGI. The beautiful and sometimes contemplative nature of the material of both pieces, contrasting with the disturbing reality it is showing, adds to the ominous tone of the two projects.
