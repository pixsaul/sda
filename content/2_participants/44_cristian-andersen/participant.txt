Cristian Andersen has been working at the interface between design and sculpture for a while.
His works are, among other things, often produced using the casting process, whereby a wide variety of materials such as ceramics, concrete or polyester-polyurethane are used and often colour pigments are added. In addition to experimenting with the above-mentioned casting techniques, Andersen also often uses metalworking in his implementation.
He is currently working on lighting objects and furniture for the ETH canteen in Zurich Oerlikon, and on his upcoming solo exhibition at the Etage Projects gallery in Copenhagen.
