The FW20/21 Homeoffice collection is a sequel to After Work Studio’s focus on knit and outdoor pieces.
Their feeling for bold graphics and feminine silhouettes combined with Swiss-made knitwear- and sportswear-inspired elements turns the collection into a unique vision.

The collection found its inspiration in the increasing number of people working from home, as well as the constant urge to convey the impression of a work career akin to perfection.
Homeoffice stands for an overly polished LinkedIn profile that could be updated while lingering in the warmth of the bed sheets in a hotel room or at home.

The main silhouettes are influenced by business suits and outdoor jackets infused with a very casual and cosy attitude and a sporty leisurewear feeling.

The collection focuses on contemporary and functional looks comprising pieces that make a statement yet are still wearable.
