Text:

The Greek Cypriot dialect was broadcast for the first time on a radio show called Cypriot Sketches in 1953, when the island’s first radio station was established by the British colonial government. An exclusively acoustic performance genre, The Cypriot Sketch draws on themes from Cypriot rural life, traditions and customs, revealing aspects of the island’s social history.
Using the scripts of three Cypriot Sketches by Andreas Koukides, this book unpacks some of the main linguistic and socio-cultural characteristics of the Greek Cypriot dialect through a system of graphic and visual annotations that are accessible to both Greek and English speakers.
Initiated diploma project at ECAL, 2019 and revised in 2020.
