In my practice I think of the photographic image as existing in a halfway state –a state of fluctuation. The centre of my focus is what comes before and what comes after: what are the circumstances under which, and what are the intentions when, a photographic image is produced? And subsequently: how is the image distributed and what purpose does its distribution serve?
A photographic image does not hold intrinsic value; I would say its value is determined in the process of making it and in the process of distributing the photograph. I enjoy working in fields where my work is confronted with applied purpose and collaborative processes. Frameworks such as a magazine, a product or a pdf constitute specific environments that my work can exist in and adapt to. The urge to engage with production and distribution of images has also led to my activity as co-publisher of Periodico magazine since 2016.
