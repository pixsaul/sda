Iâ€™m presenting the work I do as an illustrator: the drawing practice that is used in self-initiated projects but also in commissioned projects (press and institutions) between 2018 and 2020.
My practice is characterised by both a critical attitude, tinged with humour and eroticism, towards the content I work with, and an idiosyncratic and exuberant usage of black and white drawing. I depict human archetypes who are often just about to take action. They are excited, in love, envious, melancholic, bored or furious. They keep these feelings in. They are fed up with the societal constraints that they have internalised, but they are not yet ready to annihilate them. Strict virtue does not exist. Everybody desires some degree of vainglory, sex, violence, protest. That is what is of interest to me.
