Feminism. Design. Politics. Where these three intersect, you will find *Futuress*. As a queer intersectional feminist platform, *Futuress* strives to be a home for the people, histories and perspectives that have been – and still often remain – underrepresented, oppressed and ignored.

We stand together, a community for transnational solidarity. We view design as a social and political practice – one that shapes our lived realities. Design is in the words we speak, the objects around us, the things we do, the systems around us – all of which, too often, are fundamentally flawed. But design can also be a lens to critically look at the world, and unite us towards a common goal. The daunting struggles for social, spatial and environmental justice require us to come together, across our differences, as a *learning community*.

At *Futuress*, we want to reimagine the world as a classroom without walls, where learning is ubiquitous. Through this lens, in the words of Achille Mbeme, we are capable “of convening various publics in new forms of assemblies that become points of convergence [...] for the redistribution of different kinds of knowledge”. And just maybe, through these social and collective processes, by uniting passions across divides... we can enact change!
