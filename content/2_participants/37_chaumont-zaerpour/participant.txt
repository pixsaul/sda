As fashion photographers, our work is to make consumers want clothes for what they represent rather than for what they really are. This system of fashion creates identities: the assumed meaning of clothes is automatically transferred to the individual wearing them. *Fittings* explores our conditioning towards clothing.

In order to get rid of these cultural considerations, we thought of a constraint that would allow us to choose and associate clothes in our images for their plasticity and their materiality rather than for what they represent. We decided to create clothing combinations in a way that would visually recall the sensation of seasons: spring, summer, autumn, winter.

Clothing is at the same time one of the most public and one the most intimate aspects of our daily lives. The project explores this ambivalence through various steps of research, which are as many layers of photographic language. It is more about the process than the result: the visual form of the project was determined by this priority.
