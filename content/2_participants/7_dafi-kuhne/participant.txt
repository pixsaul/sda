The Dafi Kühne Printing Show™ is a series of educational online videos connecting old letterpress printing technology with contemporary design. In ten short and entertaining episodes, Dafi Kühne shares his most secret recipes for bringing a part of our cultural heritage to the 21st century.
For more than 500 years, the principle of letterpress printing was the most important printing technology worldwide. It made the mass production of books possible and broadly defined our modern typographic system that is still valid in the digital age. Letterpress printing with cast metal type on heavy analogue printing presses was replaced commercially in the 1970s by phototypesetting and later by digital systems in combination with offset printing presses.
The Dafi Kühne Printing Show™ seeks out a new format to convey old content to a younger generation and connects a heritage with fresh approaches. The ironic metaphor of a black-magic cooking show makes the rich technical content accessible and entertaining for a broader audience. Perfect for binge watching for a digital generation.
