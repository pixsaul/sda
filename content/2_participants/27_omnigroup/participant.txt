*Iâ€“DEA* is a project of Matera European Capital of Culture 2019 that explores the archives and collections of the Basilicata region in southern Italy from an artistic perspective. International artists and designers with research-based practices have been invited to guest curate five exhibitions using items sourced from archives of the region as a starting point.
In addition to developing the visual identity for the series of exhibitions, Omnigroup conceived a digital extension in the form of a sixth exhibition, an online archive of all the pieces displayed in the physical venue with the goal of making material accessible to a broader audience.
The elements of the identity, which included posters, billboards, booklets, journals and signage, are based on the digital interpretations of two typefaces originally conceived in the 1960s in Italy and Switzerland. They were rebuilt in order to create a design tool for the project that would embody the idea of archival finds made available.
