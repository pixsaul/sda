Text:

In this exhibition, we are showing a selection of books developed over the past two years which exemplify our current engagement with the book as an object. Close conceptual collaborations with artists, curators, editors and other designers are an integral part of our work. We partner with various museums and art book publishers such as Edition Patrick Frey, Spector Books, Vexer Verlag, Editioni Periferia, the Museum Rietberg and the Museum of Art Lucerne. In our practice,
we challenge the traditional habits of book design on their innovative potential. We are trying out new approaches, whether by reorganising content and typographic hierarchies or by experimenting with unconventional materials and production techniques. With our design, we intend to translate individual artistic content in an exciting and direct way.
