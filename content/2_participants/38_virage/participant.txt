*Ruban* is a pole-top luminaire system developed for the Pestalozzi square of Yverdon-Les-Bains in Switzerland.
A continuous ribbon holds the light engine around the pole and draws an unusual see-through head. With its square outlines, the pole can be adjusted in length and provide a generous surface for accessories.

Isolated, the luminaire stands out with its bold geometry, yet its straight lines disappear and blend into the architectural landscape.

Developed out of steel sheet metal, *Ruban* can be entirely produced and maintained by a local workshop. When necessary, each part can be separated and refurbished, updated, or discarded for recycling.

Independent of any centralised production, the luminaire can be reproduced and adapted to another city by local manufacture.
