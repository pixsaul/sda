Ligia Dias, *After JOSEF (BAUHAUS)*, 2020–2021

*After JOSEF (BAUHAUS)* is inspired by the Bauhaus alphabet designed by the artist Josef Albers,* who is also
the husband of Anni Albers whose jewellery work is a primal source of my artistic practice.

To make this series of earrings – and a few pendants – I have recycled laminated aluminium plate tests I found at the jewellery class I attended from 2018 to 2020. In my work, I am looking for conceptual contrasts by using antagonistic components: hardware washers with grosgrain ribbon tape, champagne bottle cork stoppers with cultured pearls... In the case of *After JOSEF (BAUHAUS)*, I have juxtaposed aluminium with 18-carat gold.

My creations are collages of multiple references and my production process is as valuable as the object I make. I aim to give a meaning to my work rather than a form or a function. Anyway, the alphabet is a traditional programme in a jewellery collection.

*Josef Albers, *Design for a universal typeface*, c. 1926
