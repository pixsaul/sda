*Crucible of Time* focuses on the reinterpretation of the myth of the Ark in the context of current global crises such as pandemics and climate change. At a time when humankind seems to be losing control over its environment, the question of what we can save arises. If we have to choose, then what would be the method that would guide our choices?

Like the photographic atlases it alludes to, *Crucible of Time* gathers fragments of the world in a kind of photographic ark, a time capsule, an interstellar bottle in space.

This work is articulated around a documentary practice and experimental work with the photographic medium. Several layers of time are superimposed. Images taken in March 2020 at the height of the pandemic in South Korea are confronted with solarigraphs exposed for several months, which reveal the changes in the trajectory of the Sunâ€™s path over successive lockdowns.
