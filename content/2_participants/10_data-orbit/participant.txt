Text:

Data Orbit’s Urgent and Moving project aims to develop solutions for editing and designing cultural publications in the digital space.
Their work operates at the interface between classic contextual book design and the possibilities of technology. This leads to coded books that operate on a multimedia basis, interlink content, and use interaction for a sensual experience.

Roy Bosier
The participatory publication encouraged readers to get involved in the editing process. The private archive of those portrayed is thereby gradually enriched with anecdotes.
*In collaboration with the Musée Visionnaire*

Walbaum
The publication acts as a hybrid of book for reading and art book.
This approach makes the working method of the Zurich poet Walbaum interactively accessible.
*In collaboration with the Musée Visionnaire*

La Luce Alpina
The catalogue extends accessibility beyond the duration of the exhibition and allows for three different directions of reading by using a split navigation.
*In collaboration with the Kunstmuseum St.Gallen*

Initiated as a diploma project for the BA in Visual Communication at Zurich University of the Arts.
