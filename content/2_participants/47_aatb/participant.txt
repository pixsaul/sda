*Rooting* is a modular tiling system for outdoor flooring. Its striking design is based on algorithms generating patterns found in nature.

*Rooting* is an extensive family of concrete tiles, with half the volume filled with soil, allowing plants, grasses and mosses to grow. *Rooting*’s reverse side is a bit like a good Swiss cheese – it is filled with holes. This permeable design allows water to drain and at the same time vegetation to take root.

There are three different types of tiles: core, transitional and peripheral; they can be arranged seamlessly, while every module can be rotated through 90 degrees to blend in with its neighbours. This provides flexibility to cover variable areas with a non-repeating pattern, creating stunning and unique spaces, terraces and pathways.

*Rooting* was developed by AATB in collaboration with Atelier Luma / Luma Arles in 2018–2020.
