Text: The studio Annina Arter, Textile & Surface Design realises projects in the areas of scenography and architecture, as well as wallpaper projects for public buildings, offices and private living spaces. The Off the Wall project adds woven murals to the product range. The scenes and narratives depicted set unique accents in the room, convey sensuality and respond to the current need for more comfort and warmth. The murals take up the present longing for strange worlds in which one can lose oneself and discover things. They create a surreal exile, a projection surface through which the viewer can escape reality for a moment. Botanical hand paintings, cyanotypes, paper cuttings and photos are digitally collaged in images. Peculiar, hidden details, naive and absurd combinations are particularly noticeable. These textile pictures are a little “off the wall”! Digital Jacquard weaving on a fine polyester warp permits an almost photorealistic implementation of the designs.
