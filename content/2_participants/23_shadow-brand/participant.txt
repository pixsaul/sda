Mass Files is a long-term project revolving around an ongoing online archive of audio field recordings taken since spring 2020. The project has manifested in a website, a poster campaign, a vinyl box set, a set of greeting cards, an invitation and a two-day event at the Swiss Institute in Milan.
After receiving a recording of a deserted beach in Buenos Aires in April 2020, artist Veronika Spierenburg approached Shadow Brand®, inspired to make a project about sound during lockdown (or the lack thereof); a digital record of this auditory discrepancy. In dialogue, key concepts were developed collaboratively, forming the cornerstones of all design and production decisions such as track duration, recordist pool, method of submission, media and design. New manifestations of the project are built on elements of the previous, remaining true to the conceptual core.
