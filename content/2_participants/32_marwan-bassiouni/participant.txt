Between January 2018 and February 2019 Marwan Bassiouni photographed the Dutch landscape from inside Muslim places of worship. Motivated by a desire to offer a different perspective on Islam and Muslim people in the West, he visited over seventy of the 400 or so mosques in the Netherlands to complete a series of 30 photographs.

His choice of locations was based on the design of mosque windows and their views of the local surroundings. In his series *New Dutch Views*, Bassiouni aims to document the diversity of Islamic Dutch architecture while suggesting both a portrait of the contemporary Dutch landscape, and a symbolic portrait of Western Muslim identity. He does so technically, by creating composite documentary photographs that merge the exteriors with the interiors.

These photographs are presented in the media, in a monographic photo book, and as an exhibition of large- scale art prints.

*New Dutch Views* is the first chapter in the long-term project *New Western Views*.
